#Dayplanner

Used moment.js to add current date and time to the top of calendar

Created time blocks and linked them to the pre-existing css styling

Added text boxes so you can type in your list

Created a color changing function to the time blocks to quickly indicate tasks for current hour

Added local storage and connected it to the save button

Local storage keeps text in designated area when you refresh page
